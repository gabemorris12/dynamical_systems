    "A hydraulic power supply (comprising a motor-driven pump and a relief valve) has the pressure-flow characteristic plotted on the left below. It drives a positive displacement hydraulic motor which in turn rotates a shaft that drives some mechanical equipment. Frictional and leakage losses in the hydraulic motor may be neglected. The characteristics of the mechanical load are plotted on the right below.\n",

    "In the above image, the source, $S$, causes a pressure difference, $P_s$, in the hydraulic rotary motor (the transformer $T$). This pressure difference causes a flow rate, $Q$, in the motor. The motor then induces a moment, $M_L$, on a shaft connected to the mechanical load, $R$. This in turn causes the load to rotate at a speed, $\\omega$. The load also produces a resistant pressure, $P_L$, on the source. This ideal machine yields the following relationships:\n",
